## Risk Scoring Explanation

The risk scoring algorithm calculates a score from 0-100 based on three main factors:

1. **Credit Score Component (50% weight)**
   - Normalizes standard credit scores (300-850) to a 0-100 scale
   - Formula: `(creditScore - 300) / 5.5`
   - Higher credit scores result in higher component values

2. **Loan Repayment History Component (30% weight)**
   - Calculates the percentage of on-time payments
   - Formula: `(successfulPayments / totalPayments) * 100`
   - More on-time payments result in higher component values

3. **Debt-to-Income Ratio Component (20% weight)**
   - Evaluates the customer's debt level relative to income
   - Formula: `100 - min(100, debtRatio * 8)`
   - Lower debt ratios result in higher component values

The final risk score is calculated as a weighted average of these components:
```
riskScore = (creditScoreComponent * 0.5) + (repaymentComponent * 0.3) + (debtRatioComponent * 0.2)
```

Risk levels are determined based on the final score:
- High Risk: Score < 40
- Medium Risk: Score 40-69
- Low Risk: Score â‰¥ 70
